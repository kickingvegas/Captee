*Captee* is a macOS app that wraps a link from the *Share menu* into either Markdown or Org syntax. Results are stored in the system clipboard for pasting into your favorite editor.

If you use *Emacs* with *Org Protocol* support, *Captee* can share links and content directly into *Emacs*.

- [[file:UserInterface.org][User Interface]]
- [[file:SharingLink.org][Sharing a link]]
- [[file:SharingCapture.org][Sharing content]]
- [[file:OrgProtocol.org][Emacs Support (Org Protocol)]]

*Captee* can be run as either a standalone app (i.e. opened from the ~Applications~ folder) or by being opened from the *Share menu*. The expected primary use case is to open *Captee* from the *Share menu* as illustrated below.
