* Emacs Org Protocol Support in Captee

*Captee* can share links and content directly into Emacs via [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Protocols.html][Org Protocol]]. Org Protocol is a custom URL scheme devised by the developers of [[https://orgmode.org/][Org]] to let 3^{rd} party apps share their content to an Org file. 

Org Protocol support for macOS is available via the [[http://yummymelon.com/scrim/][Scrim app]] (purchased separately). Alternately, if you use the Mitsuharu Yamamoto [[https://bitbucket.org/mituharu/emacs-mac/src/master/][fork of Emacs]], it offers native Org Protocol support.

The following event sequence shows how *Captee* and *Scrim* work together to get macOS content into Emacs.

 macOS App → Share Menu → *Captee* → Org Protocol → *Scrim* → Emacs

** Using Org Protocol Capture

The Org [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Capture.html][Capture]] feature provides a way to quickly store notes into an Org file. Many different kinds of notes can be defined by the user, where each different kind is defined as a /template/. All capture templates are defined in the customizable variable ~org-capture-templates~. Typically, an Org Capture note is created while inside Emacs.

The Org Protocol ~capture~ sub-protocol extends Org Capture by allowing /external/ programs to access it. In other words, with Org Protocol, programs outside of Emacs can also create a capture note.

In order to use Org Capture, you must have Emacs setup for it. This tutorial provides enough guidance to get you started with it but also notes that Org Capture is embarrassingly customizable. Readers are [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Capture-templates.html][encouraged to get a deeper understanding of it]] to make their own bespoke workflows.

*** Setup Org Capture

The following setup makes the following presumptions:
- The user keeps their Org files in a file system directory named ~org~ in their home directory.
- The user desires to keep all captured notes in a single file ~~/org/notes.org~.

The following Elisp code configures Emacs accordingly.  Put this in your ~init.el~ file.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (setopt org-directory "~/org")
  (setopt org-default-notes-file (concat org-directory "/notes.org"))
#+end_src

*** Setup Org Protocol Capture

The following Elisp configuration puts a single template definition with key name "capture" into ~org-capture-templates~. This template differs from a regular [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Template-expansion.html][Org Capture template]] in that it has [[https://orgmode.org/manual/The-capture-protocol.html][different placeholder elements]] (~%:link~, ~%:description~, ~%:annotation~, ~%i~) that are passed in via an Org Protocol URL request.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (setopt org-capture-templates
          '(("capture"
             "Org Protocol Capture"
             entry
             (file "") ; an empty string defaults to org-default-notes-file
             (function (lambda ()
                         (string-join
                          '("* %:description"
                            "%:annotation"
                            "%i"
                            "%?")
                          "\n")))
             :empty-lines 1)))
#+end_src

Note that in normal use, many different templates can be defined to create different kinds of notes. Only one template is shown here for brevity.

If the Org Protocol URL request does not have a ~template~ query parameter, then a fallback template can be specified in the customizable variable ~org-protocol-default-template-key~. For this example, we will set it to ~"capture"~.

*** Send Org Protocol ~capture~ request to Emacs

With the above configuration Elisp in place let's now exercise it by making an Org Protocol ~capture~ URL request from *Captee*. As an example, we will capture the Org Mode home page (https://orgmode.org) from Safari.

Do the following:

1. Load https://orgmode.org in Safari.
2. From the Share Menu, launch *Captee*
   - Both the Link and Title fields should populated.
3. Make sure the following configuration is used:
   - Format: ~Org Mode~
   - Payload: ~Capture~
   - Use: ~Org Protocol~
   - Template: ~capture~ (this is optional if ~org-protocol-default-template-key~ is set to ~capture~.)

In the Body text field, type in the sentence "This is the Org Mode Website."

Your *Captee* window should appear like the screenshot below. Press the blue "Capture" button at the top right hand side of the *Captee* window to make the Org Protocol request. At this point typically *Scrim* will accept the request and relay it to Emacs server. Note how *Captee* does the work of constructing the Org Protocol URL here, leaving you to focus on what's really important: the content you want to send over to Emacs.

A resulting capture window should appear in Emacs that resembles this:

[[file:images/org-protocol-capture-example.png]]

Observe how the Org Protocol-specific template placeholder elements have been populated accordingly in the capture window.
