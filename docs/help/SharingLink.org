* Sharing a Link

Sharing a link requires that the /URL/ field and optionally the /Title/ field be populated in either the share extension or main application.

The payload type /Link/ must be selected as illustrated below.

** Org Protocol

If the link is sent via [[file:OrgProtocol.org][Org Protocol]], then a message similar to what is shown below should be seen in the Emacs mini-buffer:

#+HTML: <img src="images/insert-org-link-minibuffer.png" width="80%" style="border: solid thin;"/>

This message lets you know that the Org link has been stored by Emacs. Org links are stored in a LIFO ("Last In, First Out") queue. They can be pasted into an Org buffer using the following commands:

- ~org-insert-last-stored-link~ (binding: ~C-c M-l~)
- ~org-insert-link~ (binding: ~C-c C-l~)

In Emacs, open an Org buffer and use the binding  ~C-c M-l~ to paste the link.

As the mini-buffer message states, if you only want the URL, you can paste the link using ~C-y~.
