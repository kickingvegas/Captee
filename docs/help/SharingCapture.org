* Sharing Content to be Captured

In addition to sharing a link, Captee can share text content to go along with it.

To share content, the payload type /Capture/ should be selected as illustrated below.

#+HTML: <p align="center"><img src="images/capture-selected.png" width="200px" style="border: solid thin;"/></p>

When the payload type /Capture/ is selected, the /Body/ text area is made visible. From there you can edit the text to be captured.

Note that having the /URL/ field populated is optional when the payload type is set to /Capture/.

** Sharing Selected Text to Captee

Many macOS apps support sharing selected text as a clipping. Captee supports this particularly for Emacs though Org Protocol. Shown below is an example of sharing selected text from Safari. Other macOS apps that support sharing text will have a similar workflow.

1. Select text in a web page. Use the right mouse button to raise a context menu.

   #+HTML: <img src="images/capture-selected-text-1.png" width="60%"/>
   
2. Select the menu item *Captee - Share Markup Link*.

   #+HTML: <img src="images/capture-selected-text-2.png" width="60%"/>

3. The *Captee* window will be raised with the body section populated with the selected text. The body section can be edited before sending it to Emacs via Org Protocol.

*** Sharing URL, Title, and Text
   Note that the /URL/ and /Title/ fields are not populated when sharing selected text. A work-around is to copy the selected text before sharing to Captee as described in the following steps:

   1. Select desired text in web page.
   2. Copy selected text. 
   3. Deselect text.
   4. Click on top-level Share Menu and open "Captee - Share Markup Link".
   5. Paste copied text into the *Body* text field.
   6. Click on the *Capture* button.
