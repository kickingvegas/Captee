* Sharing Content to be Captured

In addition to sharing a link, Captee can share text content to go along with it.

To share content, the payload type /Capture/ should be selected as illustrated below.

When the payload type /Capture/ is selected, the /Body/ text area is made visible. From there you can edit the text to be captured.

Note that having the /URL/ field populated is optional when the payload type is set to /Capture/.

** Sharing Selected Text to Captee

You can share selected text from a macOS app by right-mouse button clicking on it and using the *Share menu* to share to *Captee* as illustrated below.

The /Body/ text field will be populated with your selected text. This text is also editable.
